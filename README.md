# EnphaseEnvoyAPI
Enphase has made it incredibly difficult for end users to access the data available to installers, this project aims to change that.

*"You'll eat the bugs, you'll subscribe to the propeitary API for the solar panels that you 'own' and you'll be happy"*

## Current Features
* Query production and consumption data from my specific model of Enphase Envoy (more will be added if requested).
* Record power usage data to a .csv file.

## Future Plans
* Integration with [AirTouchAI](/../../../AirTouchAI) and other IoT peripherals to automatically manage energy consumption.
* Deep learning classifiers to identify peaks and patterns in power usage.
